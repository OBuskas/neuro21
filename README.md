## ðŸ§  About Neuro21

Neuro21 is a **Web3 gamified platform** that empowers people with different neurodivergences to improve their treatment journey in an engaging and rewarding way.  

Through daily goals â€” such as exercise, nutrition, and sleep â€” users earn tokens that can be exchanged for consultations with psychologists and psychiatrists registered on the platform.  

The ecosystem creates a balance of **community support and professional care**:  
- Users are motivated to build healthier habits with real incentives.  
- Psychologists and psychiatrists contribute with free monthly sessions while also offering paid consultations.  
- $ADHD Tokens circulate between users and professionals, fostering a sustainable and accessible mental health network.  

With its **gamified experience, token economy, and dual perspectives (patient and professional)**, Neuro21 blends technology, psychology, and Web3 innovation to make mental health care more **accessible, dynamic, and impactful**.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
